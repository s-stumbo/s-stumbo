While working at Panther Labs, I rewrote and reorganized every page of the docs set. To enhance clarity and consistency, I developed and implemented templates across the documentation set to ensure we included explanation, how-to, and reference content.

My target audience has often been technical administrators, but I have also written content for less-technical end-users while at Duo Security.

 - Use case docs: See the [Solutions section](https://docs.cortex.io/get-started/solutions) in the Cortex docs.
   - The Solutions pages showcase my ability to connect the "Why" with the "How-to." In the first week of being published, we were able to track that 5 prospects signed up for a demo after viewing these pages. The intention behind these pages is to not only help existing customers understand how they can better utilize features, but also to help sell the product to prospects who are looking to solve specific pain points. I have a goal to add at least one more use case per month over the next year.
 - Best practice docs: See [Measuring success with Eng Intelligence in Cortex](https://docs.cortex.io/improve/eng-intelligence#measuring-success-with-eng-intelligence-in-cortex).
   - The intention behind this content is to establish our company as an industry expert on engineering excellence, as we are selling a product that helps you drive engineering excellence. We want our docs to not only explain how to navigate through the features of Eng Intelligence, but also _why_ they should care and _what to look for_ to figure out if they're on the right track.
 - Explanation docs: See the [Panther Developer Workflows](https://docs.panther.com/panther-developer-workflows/overview) section of the docs.
 - How-to docs: See the [Panther S3 Source](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/aws/s3) docs.
 - Reference docs: See the [Panther Data Lakes](https://docs.panther.com/search/backend) docs.
