If you know me, you know I love having a process to follow. A publishing process for product docs! A GitOps process for publishing API docs! Knowledge Centered Service (KCS) process for the KB! 

In my personal life, I've also found processes I love to follow. I've come to realize that my favorite parenting process translates well to problem-solving and communicating in a professional setting. Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS) is a model of care that helps caregivers focus on identifying the problems that are causing challenging behavior in kids and solving those problems proactively and collaboratively. It was originally designed for a caregiver/child relationship dynamic, but while practicing it frequently at home with my children, I've taken away lessons that can be applied to communication in any type of setting.

The most impactful paradigm shift of the process is the reframing of undesired behavior: Kids do well when they can, not just when they want to. A child who's acting out isn't giving you a hard time, they’re having a hard time.

Makes total sense when thinking about a struggling child, but how can we apply this in the work setting?

First, we can rephrase the message to "People do well when they can." People do well when they understand expectations and when they feel mentally and physically well. Some people—especially those who are neurodivergent—may have grown up feeling ashamed when struggling in school (and eventually at work), often being told they just need to try harder or care more. The shame cycle continues when they keep trying and keep failing at certain tasks.

When I think about adult struggles in CPS terms, it feels so much less overwhelming: I am struggling to meet an expectation, and there are options for meeting the expectation while respecting your concerns and my own.

### The CPS method's options for solving problems
The CPS method describes three potential responses to solving problems:

**Plan A**: Holding an expectation that someone is having trouble meeting
- Parent/child example: A child has sensory issues that make it hard to eat dinner at the table. You force them to anyway. They end up having a meltdown. Everyone is sad and the chicken is now cold.

- Work example: Forcing yourself to meet a nearly impossible deadline at the expense of being burned out (Plan Aing yourself). Placing a demand on someone with the threat of discipline if they don't meet the demand ("Take on this new project and finish it by tomorrow or you will be written up").

**Plan B**: Solving the problem collaboratively
This is what the whole method is about! When a person is struggling, lead with curiosity: 1) Acknowledge the struggle; 2) Ask questions and drill down to find the underlying concerns; 3) Empathize with their concerns; 4) Express your own concerns (why is it important to meet the expectation?); 5) Collaboratively find a solution to the problem that meets everyone's concerns. It's important that both parties are bought in to the solution!
- Parent/Child example: Child refuses to eat at the dinner table. You get curious about what makes it difficult. After drilling down, you discover that they have a sensory issue with seeing socks. The mud room is nearby, and everyone's dirty socks from today are visible from the dinner table. After hearing their concerns and empathizing ("I agree, dirty socks are kinda gross to look at") you express your concerns ("I'd love to have you at the table with us as a family during dinner") and ask them their ideas for potential solutions. If they have no ideas, you could suggest some ("maybe we could put a laundry basket in the mud room so it's easy to put away the dirty socks?").

- Work example: A new workflow has been rolled out, and you notice that someone is not following it correctly. You lead with curiosity, asking about what makes the process difficult. After drilling down into their concerns, you determine that they're having trouble using a new software platform. You work with them to find a solution that meets your concerns ("the workflow needs to be followed correctly in order for it to be effective") and their concerns ("this software is difficult to use and slows down my other tasks"). Depending on what's making the software difficult, the solution could be more training, finding an alternate workflow within the software, scheduling time for specific tasks, etc.

**Plan C**: Dropping an expectation that someone is having trouble meeting
- Parent/Child example: It's not just the dirty socks! Turns out my son also can't tolerate certain food smells or the feeling that people are watching him eat. Who says dinner is the only time we can be together? A Plan C option would be to let him eat in a separate room (which meets his concerns) and I can spend time with him later in the day (which meets my concerns). When the food smells are too strong, we can Plan C the expectation that he will eat dinner at the table with us.


- Real-life Work example: I put an expectation on myself that not only would I post weekly in Slack about the docs updates we published, but I would also start my posts with a fun creative paragraph. It became difficult every week to think of something new to write. For a while, I Plan A'd myself into doing it anyway, which was taking more energy and time than I wanted to use. My concerns were that the updates were important and the creative intros were my "attention getters" to get eyes on the important updates. I ended up Plan C-ing it: I dropped the expectation that I could quickly come up with a creative intro to the posts every week, and started to post just the list of updates on their own. If people had stopped reading the updates, I would have revisited how to handle the situation. Fortunately, my colleagues saw the value in the posts and continued reading them!

### Learning to "Plan B" problems
Plan B sounds like common sense problem solving, but in practice it can be tricky. The drilling step is critical, but also very easy to mess up. 

It's easy to ask someone once why they're struggling, hear an initial response, and then solve for that initial response. Digging deeper is the challenge; drilling into a problem requires you to get curious, ask enough questions to understand the full spectrum of the issue, and then solve for the underlying concern. I also learned the hard way with my son that you cannot skip the empathy step and go straight to your concerns!

If you want someone to care more about your concerns, you first have to care more about theirs.
Just like the example with the dinner table, sometimes the initial solution isn't a good fit. It's not always just the dirty socks. It's ok to revisit the issue, ask more questions, and try a new solution.
You may even reexamine your concerns and realize that some of them aren't as important as you initially thought.

This isn't all to say that I robotically tell myself, "Ask a question. Okay, now empathize" while trying to solve a problem at work. However, having this process in the back of my mind does keep me in the habit of being open-minded and asking a lot of questions while troubleshooting. It also keeps me in an optimistic headspace, as it's based on the premise that everyone can succeed when they are given realistic expectations and proper support.

People do well when they can!
